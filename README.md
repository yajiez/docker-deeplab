# deeplab: Deep Learning Lab based on PyTorch and Docker

This project aim to provide a pre-defined [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) based Python environment and a fully self-contained [docker](https://www.docker.com/) based environment for Deep Learning Research.

The deep learning framework used is [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 

Tenserflow support may be added in the future. However, there is no plan for supporting Windows.
